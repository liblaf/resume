\begin{cvitems}
  \item I use ``liblaf'' as my username or nickname in many places.
        It comes from the phrase ``Life blooms like a flower''.
        The initials of each word combined form ``lblaf''.
        For ease of pronunciation, the word ``Life'' is shortened to its first two letters and the ``l'' is replaced with ``li'', resulting in ``liblaf''.
  \item Do you know why I always wear a hood?
        It's because I was once hit on the head by a caterpillar that fell from a tree!
