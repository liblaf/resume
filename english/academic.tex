    Traditional LBS methods achieve 3D face reconstruction by controlling the shape of the surface mesh, which is achieved by the position and weight of bone joints.
    However, this method often produces results that do not correspond to anatomy or kinematics when dealing with complex bone and facial shapes.
    Therefore, this project aims to use physical methods to simulate the physical behaviors of bones and muscles, predict the surface of the face, and better reconstruct 3D faces.

    In order to improve performance, high-level mobile applications call low-level native code libraries primarily written in C/C++ (in the form of .so library).
    When the native code library has defects, it affects many mobile applications and poses security risks.
    This project aims to design and develop innovative testing methods based on the existing work to automatically generate high-level application code fragments and effectively test existing mobile native code libraries using techniques such as fault injection and concurrency analysis.
